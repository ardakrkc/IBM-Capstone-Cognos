# IBM-Capstone-Cognos

In this Capstone Project of IBM's Data Analytics Proffesional Certificate Course, I used IBM's Cognos Analytics to create dashboards and visuals on surveys for respondents working in tech industries.

Exported 2 csv files including the survey datas and created dashboards with visuals on respondent top 10 programming languages, databases, platforms and webframes this year and their desires next year on these topics again.

Also created visuals of age,gender and countries of the respondents to understand their interest according to these topics.
